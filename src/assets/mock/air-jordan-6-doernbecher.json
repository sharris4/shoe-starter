    "description": "In celebration of the 15 year anniversary of the Doernbecher Freestyle collection, Nike reintroduces Jordan Dark's Air Jordan VI.    In 2009, Jordan Dark shared two significant dates of his journey on his very own Air Jordan VI. 06/08 for his first day of chemo. 04/09 representing his last. The midnight navy and varsity red upper speak to his high school's colors while the outsole introduces the first ever all-translucent outsole on a Air Jordan VI. Now 21 years old, Jordan remains cancer-free. When wearing his shoes he’s been recognized by sneaker fans as far away as New York City. His advice to future designers: Take your time, beauty is always in the details. All proceeds benefit children’s health and well-being at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital.",
